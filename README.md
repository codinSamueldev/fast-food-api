# Fast-food API!
> [!NOTE]
> The API could take up to 1 minute to respond because of the free host service (Hope you understand ðŸ™ˆ)

Hi there! this API was created in order to learn FastAPI framework. While I was developing the API I had two great challenges I could overcome, the first one was developing the security flow with JWT.
It is no a big surprise for junior developers how tedious (and important) can be the implementation of security on our web apps. Well, this time was not different.
I had to learn how to encode user information so as to the API could generate unique tokens for each user stored in the database, also, to return that token to the auth endpoint so users after creating their accounts and logged in successfully, they could retrieve the information stored of the endpoints secured.
On the other hand, deploying the API was the second tough challenge I faced. I was not sure if deploying just with the repo, or creating a docker image. I end up doing both. I deployed on Render and I had to make critical changes to the code so I could deploy successfully.

To sum up, I enjoyed developing this project, even though I struggled, I could take my time to do it my way. 
Okay, that's it, hope you can share to me some feedback about it, cheers!
